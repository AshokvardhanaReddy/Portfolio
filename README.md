# Education

I Completed my graduation in B.Com ( Computers ) in 2016. After my graduation, I wanted to prepare for bank exams. So I joined Mahindra Banking Institute in Hyderabad, I took 8 months of coaching for bank exams. After that, I came to my nearest city to prepare for exams. While I was preparing for banking exams, I also worked in a medical shop for a few years and a few months with Zomato.


# Journey At Masai


Before joining Masai School, I was working as an amazon delivery executive. Then a few of my friends suggested me to learn software Programming languages. But I did not know where to learn and how to learn. Then I found Masai School on Youtube and I enrolled for the Full Stack Web Development course.

At Masai School, I learnt technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, MERN Stackvalong with Data Structures and Algorithms. soft skills and Problem-Solving skills and used them in the two projects that I was a part of, one of which was clone of Juicy Chemistry and the other was Bodywise.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
